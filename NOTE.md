## Intro 
Terraform is IaC created from HashiCorp. Using the Hashi Configuration Language you can write human readible code to deploy infrastructure in a few minues.
The language is declarative, you need to write the end state of your infrastructure. For example if you already deployed 5 instances of a server and you need a total of 10 you don't need to worry about checking and calculating the instances already running when making the changes (like you would do with Ansible). You just update the configuration with the number of desired resources.
